# No longer then

No longer then helps us to not waste food by gathering information 
about how long fruits and vegetables can be stored. Because there is not much 
information found about that on the Internet, the community can add comments 
with their observations.

Additionally, registered users can store on their accounts they own food with 
the starting date, and will receive notifications when the food is close to expiry.
